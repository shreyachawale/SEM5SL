-also known as Caesar cipher
-the shift cipher relies on shifting letters by a fixed amount


PART 1: copy cipher text to part 3 cipertext text area

start shifting till the plain text makes sense 

paste in part 4 and shift key to check


Theory:
is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet.
ENCRYPTION PROCESS:
The shift value 'k' determines how many positions each letter is moved.
For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on
The encryption formula is: E(x) = (x + k) mod 26, where 'x' is the numerical value of the letter and 'k' 
is the shift value. 
DECRYPTION PROCESS:
 the receiver knows the shift value 'k' and simply 
shifts each letter backward in the alphabet. - The decryption formula is: D(x) = (x - k) mod 26.
