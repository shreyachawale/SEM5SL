Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) capable of performing packet logging and real-time traffic analysis. It can detect threats and suspicious activity based on rules and patterns.

Installation: Snort is available for both Linux and Windows. The installation involves 
downloading the Snort package from its official source and following the setup process. 
During installation, you specify the network interface that Snort will monitor. 

Configuring Snort 
-Configuration File: The main Snort configuration file specifies the network variables, rule 
paths, and preprocessors . It also defines how Snort handles and logs alerts and what traffic patterns to monitor
-Preprocessors: These are modular add-ons that extend Snort's capabilities, enabling it to 
detect various network anomalies, such as port scanning or fragmented packets.

Adding Rules 
-Rules: Snort uses predefined rules to detect specific types of network activity that could 
indicate malicious behavior. These rules define patterns, actions to take (such as logging 
or alerting), and the traffic to inspect. Users can create custom rules or use 
communitycontributed rule sets.  
- Structure: A Snort rule consists of an action (alert, log, etc.), protocol, source/destination 
IP addresses, ports, and specific options that define the detection logic.
