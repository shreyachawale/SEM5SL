The Vigenère cipher is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
builds upon the simple Caesar cipher by introducing a keyword that determines the shifting pattern for each letter.

How the Vigenere Cipher Works:   
-Choosing a Keyword:
-Matching the Keyword Length: Repeat the keyword to match the length of the plaintext you want to encrypt.
-Converting to Numerical Values: Convert both the keyword and the plaintext into numerical values based on their positions in the alphabet.
-Shifting with the Keyword: Starting with the first letter of the keyword and the corresponding letter in the plaintext, add their numerical values together (mod 26) to get the encrypted letter. In 
our case: - Letter "H" (numerical value 7) + Letter "K" (numerical value 10) = 17, which correspond 5.
-Convert the numerical values of the encrypted letters back to their corresponding letters in the alphabet. The encrypted version of "HELLO" with the keyword "KEY" is "RIFNP."  

To simplify the process, the Vigenère cipher often uses a table known as the Vigenère square or Vigenère table. Each row of the table corresponds to a shift of the alphabet by one letter.

The Kasiski Test is a cryptanalysis technique used to decipher the Vigenère cipher by determining the 
length of the keyword used for encryption
