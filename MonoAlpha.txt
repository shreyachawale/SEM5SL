we learnt that the large key space is necesary for secrecy. However, we will now see that large key space is not always sufficient either.
it is quite easily broken using "Frequency analysis" methods.
To understand that just having a large keyspace is not enough to achieve secure encryption.

Theory:
is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced 
by the same corresponding letter in the ciphertext. The substitution remains constant throughout the 
encryption process.  
Encryption Process:   
where each letter in the alphabet is mapped to its respective substitution.  
For example, 'A' is replaced with the first letter of the key, 'B' with the second letter, and so on. - Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged in the ciphertext.   
Decryption Process: - To decrypt the ciphertext, the receiver uses the same key to look up the corresponding plaintext letters for each letter in the ciphertext.   
Brute Force Attack on Monoalphabetic Cipher:
A brute force attack on a monoalphabetic cipher is not practical because there are 26!
